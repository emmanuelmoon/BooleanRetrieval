# Proximity and Boolean Query Search

This is a Python project for running boolean and proximity queries on a given set of research papers.

## Installation
You need to clone to the directory. Make to sure to clone the ".pkl" file as they contain the indices. You need a recent version of Python which should includes:
-tkinter
-pickle
-re

These packages come by default in the latest python versions.
It also needs **nltk** to run but I've added a cell in the python notebook to install it.

```bash
pip install nltk
```

## Run

In order to perform search.
1. Run the "RunQueries.ipynb" in a jupyter notebook environment
1. Run all cells from top to bottom for it to work.

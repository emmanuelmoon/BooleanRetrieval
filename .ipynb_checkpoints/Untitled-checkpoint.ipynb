      "The historical overview provided in this article hints at a categorization of explanations. This categorization relies on\n",

      "Expert systems were one of the first realizations of applied AI, where the aim was to build systems able to aid\n",

      "to develop intelligent systems able to reason, draw new conclusions, and to generate explanations. Explanations in\n",
      "these systems consisted of either descriptions coupled to the reasoning trace of the system, or descriptions decoupledfrom the reasoning itself, but more focused on the story behind the decision-making process itself.

      "these systems were usually human-understandable. Nonetheless, acquiring and modeling domain knowledge is a com-\n",

      "Machine learning was introduced to alleviate this knowledge acquisition problem. Machine learning algorithms are\n",
      "indeed capable of identifying data patterns from (in most cases) large amounts of data, but this often happens at the\n",
      "price of creating black-box models. An explanation in these systems is mainly understood as an interpretable modelthat approximates the behavior of the underlying black-box. Explanations of this type allow users to understand why a\n",
